// Although MongoDB doesn't enforce any data normalization, the database collections will 
// benefit from at least a little bit of structure. Mongoose fills that need, allowing us 
// to add rules for the data so that it's not a free-for-all. Mongoose also provides us with 
// a lot of similar capabilities that Sequelize offers, like data validation, prebuilt methods 
// to perform actions on a MongoDB database collection, and much more.

// We could import the entire mongoose library, but we only need to worry about the 
// Schema constructor and model function, so we'll just import them.
